# Ahmed Qureshi

Hi! I'm currently a software developer specialized in back-end Java RESTful Web Services/API. 

I hold 2 bachelor's degrees, (1) B.S. in Computer Science from SUNY Old Westbury and (2) B.S. in Biology from SUNY Stony Brook. 

## Who am I?

I was born and raised in NY where my family resides, and currently working in CT. There are a multitude of things I like to do! I love improving my skillset and building code from scratch. In terms of professional development, I try to learn how to simplify and modularize my code further, without sacrificing speed or readability.

More on the personal side, I also love learning how to cook new foods, exercise, spend time with family/friends, swimming, outside activities such as paintball, gaming and more!

## Interests

I have a problem of having an interest in holding/understanding too many skillsets. Although I work with web services, I do have a liking for machine learning, robotics, embedded systems, virtual reality, etc. Imagine developing something which you can touch or feel! 

To get down to the nit-gritty, here is the summary of my skills:

## Skills
