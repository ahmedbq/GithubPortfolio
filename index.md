## Ahmed Qureshi

Hi! I'm currently a software developer specialized in back-end Java RESTful Web Services/API. I have 2 bachelor's degrees, (1) B.S. in Computer Science from SUNY Old Westbury and (2) B.S. in Biology from SUNY Stony Brook. 

### Who am I?

I was born and raised in NY where my family resides, and I am currently working in CT. There are a multitude of things I like to do! Of course, I love improving my skillset and building code from scratch. But more on the personal side, I also love learning how to cook new foods, exercise, spend time with family/friends, swimming, outside activities, gaming and more!
